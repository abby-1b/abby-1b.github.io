This is my site!

Go [here](https://abby-1b.github.io/site) to access the actual site.

# Why does the site redirect to `/site`?

This website uses the Spells compiler, which isn't directly compatible with HTML
and must therefore be compiled. The source is in `/src`, which gets compiled
into the `/site` directory.
